## Why Coaching?
Coaching for individuals is a relatively new concept. You could ask – when I have access to so much information why would I need a coach to help me define and achieve my goals?

The key is that there is a difference between knowing something, and acting on it. Only by relating a goal to <u>your</u> personal values and incorporating it into your life will it live for you as your personal goal and become part of <u>your</u> life.

The job of a coach is to use skilful questioning to get to the heart of the matter; to help you determine your core values; define the commitments which shape your life and design a life which would be the highest expression of those values and commitments.

Having created a plan to bridge the gap between your ideal life and your current one, a coach is tasked to hold you accountable to your plan – or change it. 

On the way, limiting beliefs will try to stop you and sabotage will raise its ugly head, and it is through the coaching relationship that you can learn why you have been stopped in the past – and why this time, you will succeed.

If not now, when? As Mary Oliver puts it:

> Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?
