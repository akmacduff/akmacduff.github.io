				<!--**Struggling to achieve your goal?**-->
<!--**How knowing your personality type can help you play to your strengths.**-->
<p>To find your personality type, answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Being with people
    <ul>
      <li>gives me energy,</li>
      <li>tires me so I need time alone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I am motivated by
    <ul>
      <li>getting things done,</li>
      <li>helping people with what they need to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Broadly speaking, question 1. distinguishes the extroverts who get stimulatedby being with people, from introverts who need to rest after being withpeople.</p>

<p>Question 2. separates people who are a) task focused and take pride in ticking off a To Do list from b) people who are people focused and measure their success by the responses from the people in their lives.</p>

<p>These broad generalisations (discovered by the psychologist William Moutlton Marston and later made into the DISC behaviour assessment tool) can be used to analyse how we can use the strengths of our personality types to achieve our goals more easily.</p>

<p>For example, take the 4 different personality types and how they could use their personality strengths in relation to e.g. getting fit:</p>

<p><strong>Type 1.</strong> A task-focused extrovert is a natural leader and would rise to challenges - especially if it was up to them to show others the way. This personality type thrives on taking charge and getting things done -strategies that they could use would be to launch some sort of challenge to other members of their group e.g. a squash league at the gym; qualifying for a triathlon; improving on their personal best. These people thrive on finishing tasks, measuring their progress and healthy competition with others. As long as the outcome is largely within their control they will do their very best.</p>

<p><strong>Type 2.</strong> A task-focused introvert will also be motivated by measured goals, but they won't want to be in competition with others. Instead, their self-discipline and strong analytical skills mean that they work best by creating a routine. They are the sort of people who put gym time/exercise in their diary and do it religiously. They plan their shopping, pre-prepare meals, calorie-count, use heart monitors, keep food and exercise diaries and know exactly what works and doesn't work for them. Organisation skills are their strength, perfectionism is their downfall, but by creating a routine that supports them and a little wriggle room for the occasional lapse, they make steady and consistent gains.</p>

<p><strong>Type 3.</strong> People-focused extrovert thrive in groups and with an audience. These charismatic people inspire others and live for praise and popularity. They are outgoing and persuasive and so can keep a group of people motivated. By sharing their ups and downs on e.g. social media, they avoid the loneliness of tackling their goal alone and unsupported. They will spend just as much time in classes as outside them, generating enthusiasm and bonding with the rest of the class. Any exercise that seems fun and where they can inspire others will be more successful for them. If you are a people-focused extrovert, try joining an exercise group on Instagram and upload your inspiring recipes and latest exercise triumphs.</p>

<p><strong>Type 4.</strong> People-focused introverts work well in a supportive role. If they can find a colleague or friend who wants to exercise but needs a bit of a push, this type of personality will be your ideal 'gym-buddy'. They are so loyal, they will never let you down. Also, they have great staying power and will be the people that complete the series of classes, never missing one. They can occur as quiet and shy and probably won't make the first move- so will let other personality types take the lead. If you are a people-focused introvert who hasn't yet been asked to 'dance', you can still use your strengths to set up an exercise routine at home, using home equipment, DVDs, videos etc. Due to your reflective nature, you may enjoy more interior-focussed styles of exercise e.g. yoga. Most of us are a combination of these personality types - with one style which tends to be dominant. Whilst these are only broad generalisations, they may help you work out new strategies that play on your strengths and also explain why some strategies don't work for you no matter how much effort you put 
into them.</p>

<p>Find out what style you think you are and try applying it to the current goals in your life - are you fully utilising the strengths of your personality to achieve these goals or are you trying to be someone else? What new options for action are now open to you? Have fun playingâ€¦</p>
