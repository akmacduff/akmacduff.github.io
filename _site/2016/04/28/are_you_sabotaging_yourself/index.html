				<p>Are you sabotaging yourself?</p>

<p>We start projects with the best intentions, then they fail and we claim that we didn’t know why… But if you really took the time to examine it, you would probably find one or more of the following culprits:</p>

<p><strong>1.	Setting too big a goal.</strong></p>

<p>Are you trying to halve your calorie intake? Double the length of your run?</p>

<p>We are creatures of habit. Good habits are beneficial activities that have become unconscious – we <u>don’t</u> have to build the motivation to do them, in fact, we experience a nagging thought in the back of the mind when we don’t do them. However, habits create inertia for big changes – something that was unconscious now becomes conscious and involves more effort. It’s easier to adjust your action by 5-10% over 21 days and repeat, than try and make big shifts.</p>

<p><strong>2.	Setting a goal that’s not specific.</strong></p>

<p>‘Improve my health’, ‘work on my relationship’ are not specific goals, and, consequently, you won’t know when you have achieved them. Without a sense of achievement, there is little motivation to continue the action.</p>

<p>Break your goal down into small, specific steps eg. ‘attend gym class on Wednesday morning’ or ‘go out with phones turned off, on Friday nights’.</p>

<p>Test each action to see which brings you nearer your goal, get inventive and celebrate your success.</p>

<p><strong>3.	Focus on statistics rather than feelings.</strong></p>

<p>Are you focusing on a number? A pay rise/ideal weight/bank balance?</p>

<p>Instead, what does the number mean to you? How will you feel when you have achieved it? What will it mean to the rest of your life and to the people around you?</p>

<p>Focusing on a number can become a burden and sometimes achieving the number doesn’t give you the feeling you wanted. Instead, look at what that number would give you – a pay rise may mean for you that you are valued and being rewarded. What other actions can you take on to create this?</p>

<p><strong>4.	Cutting out versus cutting down</strong></p>

<p>Are you trying to go ‘cold turkey’ and give up something e.g. sugar/alcohol/cigarettes?</p>

<p>What does this activity give you e.g pleasure/relaxation/comfort? Look for replacements; would you get the same feeling from a bath/nap/walk outside/listening to music? If you focused on activity which gave you pleasure instead, would this reduce the likelihood of sabotage?</p>

<p>Find out what your triggers are for this behaviour e.g. what mood are you in? who are you with? what are you doing? What plans could you make to avoid these triggers e.g. always having a healthy snack with you/buying smaller bottles of wine/packs of cigarettes.</p>

<p>Instead of going ‘cold turkey’, build in conscious attention to the activity – do it without distractions, almost like a meditation and feel the moment when you have had enough and stop –and throw away what’s left.</p>

<p>Start making an unconscious activity conscious so that you have a choice and celebrate all the small wins as the new behaviours become good habits.</p>

<p><strong>5.	Waiting for the motivation.</strong></p>

<p>As Oliver Burkeman stated in The Guardian newspaper 23/4/2016, studies have shown that building motivation takes more energy that simply just doing the activity – so just do it!</p>

<p><strong>6.	Putting others/work/etc first and making excuses.</strong></p>

<p>Ask yourself ‘what does this sabotaging behaviour cost me?’ What would you have, if you achieved your goal? What are all the things you could be doing if you weren’t making excuses and choosing to put yourself second? What do your family/friends really want for you?</p>

<p>What benefit do you get from not working on your goals? This may not be clear at first but there is always a payoff to the things we do, otherwise we wouldn’t do them – it may be a feeling of noble suffering/superiority/sacrifice etc but if we really asked the people in our lives whether they want us doing this, rather than working towards our goals, I think you know what they would say.</p>

<p><strong>7.	Feeling oppressed by your goal.</strong></p>

<p>Then change the goal. Break it down to small steps and make it achievable. Check – is it still what you want or have things changed? Do an assessment of your strengths and weaknesses to make sure you’re using strategies that exploit your strengths and minimise reliance on your weaknesses. Create a vision of what it will be like when you succeed that is bigger than your limitations/doubts/resistance and get into action- however small.</p>

<p><strong>8.	Limiting beliefs.</strong></p>

<p>Sabotage can often be caused by statements about the world or ourselves which we have accumulated over the years and believe to be true but which create self-imposed limits on what we think we can achieve in the world and who we are. These statements are often invisible to us– the people in our lives may be aware of them and that can be a place to start, however, working on limiting beliefs is central to the coaching process and provides a confidential space to explore these issues so that they no longer stop you from achieving your goals and creating a life that you love.</p>
