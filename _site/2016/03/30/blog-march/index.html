				<p><em>Are you trying to squeeze more into an already full life?</em></p>

<p>Have you ever noticed that so many things that could improve your life involve adding … <strong>more?</strong></p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>more</strong> time in the gym/with the kids/meditating/jogging</li>
  <li><strong>more</strong> information about getting fit/healthy eating/how to succeed</li>
  <li><strong>more</strong> attention to your loved ones/the present moment</li>
  <li><strong>more</strong> action around career goals/marketing yourself/searching for The One.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in my experience, trying to put more into a cup which is already full just results in overflow. In our lives that can feel like overwhelm - resulting in less sleep, poor health, low self esteem, guilt and even shame.</p>

<p>We are led to believe that if we only knew/did/had/were … (fill in the gap yourself) our lives would be perfect, and when we fail and end up feeling worse about ourselves – and less likely to try again.</p>

<p>Part of the job of a coach is to help you empty the cup – review your life to look at what’s working and, in areas of your life which aren’t working, examine what you have been doing and what you have learnt about yourself.</p>

<p>Part of emptying the cup also involves discarding the ‘shoulds’ in your life so that you are left with <u>your</u> core values – the ones that get you up in the morning. These values will be reflected in what you are committed to in life and the strengths that get you through the day.</p>

<p>Coaching can act like a knife to cut away everything that isn’t <u>you</u> or aligned with <u>your</u> values. Clients experience a clarity of vision that can be exhilarating, liberating the energy trapped in previous failed attempts, to be redirected into the strengths that have already got you this far.</p>

<p><u>For example</u>, who wants to lose weight? How many times have you tried and how much energy have you expended on this? However, to ‘lose weight’ covers many different areas- e.g. how healthy you feel, your size, what you eat, your shape.
What would it be like to give up the idea of losing weight? How would it feel to be ok about the weight you are now? Notice how your body responds to that thought.</p>

<p>Instead, what is it <u>specifically</u> that you want?</p>

<ul>
  <li>To feel toned/fit into a size smaller?</li>
  <li>To feel less out of breath?</li>
  <li>To sleep better?</li>
  <li>To give up coffee/sugar/alcohol/chocolate/smoking?</li>
  <li>To have more energy?</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Choose one area</u> and look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when you have tried and failed - and what you said about yourself.</li>
  <li>what you think you ‘should’ do/be/have in this area.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you gave up all the regrets/blame/sense of failure, what one step could you do today to give you a positive result in this area?</p>

<p>Make it something that you enjoy, something that you are already good at or something that is aligned to a commitment you already have.</p>

<p>We are filled to the brim with knowledge, but knowledge isn’t enough until it works in the service of <u>your</u> values, <u>your</u> strengths and <u>your</u> commitments. 
Enjoy!</p>
