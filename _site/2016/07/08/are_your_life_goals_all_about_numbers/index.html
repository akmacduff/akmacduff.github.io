				<p><strong>Are your life goals all about numbers?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are you focusing on getting that pay rise/into a size 12/to 9 stone/8 hours sleep/ level 6 on the Cross Trainer?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is life starting to sound like a To Do list with too much on it and too little time to do it all?</strong></p>

<p>So often, we hear that coaching is about making SMART goals i.e. Specific, Measurable, Agreed upon, Realistic and Time Bound. But we can end up focusing on the action as a To Do, rather than the feelings and values that achieving this goal would bring.</p>

<p>How will you feel when you get that pay rise/dress size/sleep/level offitness/slimness? Let me guess.. happy? fulfilled? joyous? successful? valued? confident?</p>

<p>So what about focusing on that feeling instead? For example, how can you build confidence/being valued/joyous/fulfilled/successful into your life right now, doing what you have to do anyway?</p>

<p>Instead of finding more things to do, change <u>how</u> you are doing the things you already do.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to feel fit/sleep better, how can you move more in a day? Become an analyst of your own life - what's in your calendar that you could add movement to? Getting to and from work/school/shops? Spending time with children/friends/your partner? Get creative about that feeling of being fit and mimic what a fit person would do.</p>

<p>If a pay rise would make you feel valued, where else could you cultivate an attitude of value? When you begin to see life through the prism of value, you start to not only value people/services/places, but also what you bring to the table - what would be missing if you weren't there? Where else in your life would you like to provide value? What could you do to value yourself more?</p>

<p>When we get hung up on a number, we lose the real goal i.e. <u>how we want to feel</u> once we have achieved the goal. We lose our focus and creativity and become like a machine, hacking away doggedly to get to the number, only to find, guess what, that we can achieve the number and still not experience the feeling.</p>

<p>How many times have you thought and believed that your life would be so much better if you got that job/relationship/weight/dress size and found that, when you got it, you didn't feel any different or that the feeling didn't last or you even felt disappointed that it wasn't worth all the effort?</p>

<p>Holding onto a number as a specific measure of your level of success in life is exhausting and will be frustrated by the way life constantly changes. Nothing stays static, and events will occur which sabotage your precious number - and then how will you feel?</p>

<p>Instead of fixed goals, <u>focus on the value or feeling that you want to create</u> in your lives and start treading that path from Day 1 and keep walking with that as your intent, looking for any and every opportunity to express it as a way of life - not just another action on our To Do list.
Wishing you well on your journeyâ€¦.</p>
